              <p>Junko Furuta's case is considered the Worst Death in History for the following reasons:
                <ul>
                  <li>Rape – Junko was raped over 500 times in 44 days. Many of these rapes were gang rapes, in which friends of the four boys were invited to participate and humiliate her. At some point, over 100 different men were involved in the rape.</li>
                  <li>Cut in the vagina – Foreign objects such as iron bars, scissors, needles, thread, light bulbs, fireworks, cigarettes and lighters were forcibly inserted into her vagina and anus, causing severe burns and injuries. Furthermore, she forcibly pierced her breast with a sewing needle and tore off one of her nipples.</li>
                  <li>Beating – She was beaten regularly, sometimes tied up like a human punching bag. The boys displeased them by punishing her with sticks and bamboo sticks.</li>
                  <li>Frozen – After begging to die, she was locked overnight (remember it was winter) and later locked in a fridge.</li>
                  <li>Burned – This is believed to be the final cause of his death. She was badly burned by the aforementioned lighter and fireworks. When she tried to call the police, she was doused with lighter fluid and her body caught fire. She somehow survived, but was killed by another boy on her 40th day of imprisonment.</li>
                </ul>
